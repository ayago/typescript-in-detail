## Installation

1. Install typings `npm install -g typings` or if you have installed typings globally already use go to directory and command `npm link typings`
2. Install webpack globally `npm install -g webpack` if you haven't do so yet
3. Setup *lesson5* as npm project by going to its directory and typing `npm install` to install setup based on *package.json*.

## Deployment/Trying it out

1. In *lesson5* directory, command `webpack` to build *dist/bundle.js* so that *index.html* can access it via src tag as specified
2. Copy path or type file directory of *index.html* in browser preferrably on chrome.
